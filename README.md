## AI Image Editor

[![coverage](https://github.com/leom806/ai-image-editor/blob/main/server/coverage/coverage.svg)](https://github.com/leom806/ai-image-editor/blob/main/server/coverage/)

Hey, it's nice to see you here!

This project is currently a simple image editor that uses external AI to add special powers to it.

Currently AI providers:
  - OpenAI DALL-E
  - Stability

**Midjourney will be added as soon as they provide a public API**

I'm also the author of [Midjourney Ruby](https://github.com/leom806/midjourney-ruby), a Ruby wrapper for the Midjourney service that I'll turn into a wrapper for their API once it's there.

#### Tech Stack

The frontend is built with Vue.js and TailwindCSS.
The backend is built with Rails and PostgreSQL.

It's not hosted anywhere yet, but you can run it locally.

#### Running locally

Personally I enjoy running my servers manually but feel free to make a Procfile/Docker set up if you like!

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies
  - `cd client && npm install`
  - `cd server && bundle install`
3. Set up the database
  - `cd server && rails db:setup db:seed`
4. Run the frontend server in one terminal
  - `cd client && npm run dev`
5. Run the backend server
  - `cd server && rails server`
6. Open `http://localhost:5173/` in your browser and enjoy! ðŸŽ‰

You'll need to set up the environment variables for the backend to work with the AI providers if you want.
Just create one account at Stability and/or OpenAI and look for their API Keys.

#### Contributing

Feel free to open a PR or an issue if you find something that could be improved.
At this point there are many features and improvements to be made, so I'll be happy to accept any help.
